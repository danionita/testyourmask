# testyourmask

As part of the [EUVvsVirus hackathon](https://euvsvirus.org/), we developed an app to classify face masks based on their filtration capabilities using the HRM sensor from Samsung Galaxy phones.
The app is still in it's early stages, bit we are getting promising results and We are are planning to make it freely available on the Play Store.
